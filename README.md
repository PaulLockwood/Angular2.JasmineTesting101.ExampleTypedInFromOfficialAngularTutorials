# Angular2 Jasmine Testing 101 (From Official Angular Tutorials)
There was no git repo to download so I had to type this in by hand! This repo should save time for everyone else

git clone https://github.com/PaulLockwood/Angular2.JasmineTesting101.ExampleTypedInFromOfficialAngularTutorials.git
cd Angular2.JasmineTesting101.ExampleTypedInFromOfficialAngularTutorials
npm install

// Optional to compile your TypeScript. I let Atom do that:
npm start

// In any Brower open src/unit-tests.html
